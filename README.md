Hi there! Welcome to the url-gem activity!

This is a small challenge we can use to practice a number of skills that you'll 
find useful as a software developer. For example, exploring Ruby's standard library,
procedural and object-oriented design, various documentation resources, will all be covered.

1) Open the url.rb file.

2) In the console, type "ruby url.rb" and press the Enter key

3) Make some changes to the file, save, run the above command, and have fun!

Happy coding!


## Support & Documentation

### Ruby
You'll find https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.2/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI.html useful in completing this activity.

### URLs
RFC 3986 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 describes URIs, URLs, and URNs. You won't need to know everything there, but being comfortable reading and understanding RFCs can be useful. Don't worry about reading the whole thing from start to end. RFCs can be dry reading.
